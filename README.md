# tree-sitter-powershell

A [tree-sitter] grammar for the PowerShell language.

*This is still very much a WIP* and isn't something i'd recommend depending on!

The goal of this project is to build a grammar that is useful in the Atom editor (and to learn how grammars work).

# Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome!

This is a side-project for fun, so please be understanding if responses take a little bit of time :smile:

# References

This grammar is (very roughly) modeled after the [Windows PowerShell Language Specification Version 3.0][spec].
